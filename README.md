# FNFFAutoFire
This is a dead-simple command line calculator for Cyberpunk 2020's FNFF automatic
fire rules.

## Armor rules
This currently uses the 'old' armor values (no bonus for stacking armor), and
takes cover SPS values into account

## Cover rules
Partial cover will redirect all shots to the torso and head. Full cover assumes
you're firing through a wall at the target and will hit all parts of the body.

## Fragile!
I made this in an hour. It expects integers and y/n values only. Be gentle.
